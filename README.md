# Repository and Web authoring tool for micro learning content
Tech stack: Django, Python, MongoDB, Javascript, HTML and CSS. 
The aim of this project is to build a Repository and Web authoring
tool for micro learning content which allows the instructors to have an overall control over the
micro learning content they create. That includes all the stages from the registration of the
instructor in the platform to the creation and edition of every micro content of his own. In
these stages there are three different actors: the system (the repository and authoring tool);
the instructor, who will carry on most of the actions; and the administrator of the site.
